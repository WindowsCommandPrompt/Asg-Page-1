## Project Name 

**Name: ** The ultimate game   
(sounds weird but yea)

<br> 
<hr> 
<br> 

## Design Rationale
Tried to create two different types of games. One game is the board game whereas the other game is the ( ) 


<br> 
<hr> 
<br> 

## Technologies used

<ul> 
  <li> jQuery </li> 
    <ol> 
      <li> <b> In terms of syntax, </b> </li> 
        <ol> 
          <li> jQuery syntax can be easily understood within a shorter period of time, through high code readability. DOM Manipulation would be easier with the help of jQuery, such as introducing new DOM elements, with the help of in-built jQuery functions such as <code>before()</code>, <code>after()</code>, and updating existing DOM elements such as <code>append()</code>, <code>html()</code>, <code>text()</code>, and changing CSS directly in a single JavaScript file without have to toggle between a CSS file and a JS file. I can just simply use <code>css()</code> to update css when needed, etc. DOM Navigation has also been made easier with the help of jQuery. In-built methods would include <code>children()</code>, <code>parent()</code>, <code>previous()</code>, and <code>next()</code>. Developers like me would be able to get more out of JavaScript through writing less code with the help of jQuery Even though, the code that you have written in jQuery would later be coverted in JavaScript, which results in a longer compiling time.</li> 
          <br>
          <li> In traditional JavaScript, to send to and receive data from a server VIA a server request, we will have to use <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, which may seem more complicated as compared to <code>jQuery.ajax()</code> in jQuery. Making ajax calls is just so much easier as compared to <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>.</li> 
          <br>
          <li> <code>jQuery(document).ready(function(){ }); </code> makes it easier for me to insert a loading animation while the website is still loading.</li> 
        </ol>
      <br>  
      <li> <b> You will learn traditional JavaScript faster through jQuery.</b> </li>
        <ol>
          <li> Previously it took me a while to understand certain things like <code>addEventListener</code> in JavaScript. In </li> 
        </ol>  
    </ol>
  <br>  
  <li> CSS Keyframes </li> 
    <ol> 
      <li> <b> 100% dependance on someone else's animation is not fun at all</b> </li> 
      <ol> 
        <li> I have decided to use some </li> 
      </ol> 
    </ol> 
  <br> 
  <li> Restdb.io </li> 
    <ol> 
      <li> </li> 
      <li> </li> 
    </ol> 
  <br> 
  <li> Lottie files </li> 
    <ol> 
      <li> Provides short animations that takes up less storage space on my device. </li> 
    </ol>
  <br>  
  <li> Adobe XD </li> 
    <ol> 
      <li> Used for creating the wireframes for the website. Important because I still have to ensure that the webpage looks well organised, through proper web semantics, and usage of appropriate html tags and css styling. </li> 
      <br> 
      <li> In order to ensure that my webpages are fully responsive with changing screen widths, and changing heights. </li> 
      <br> 
      <li>Most importantly have a referecing blueprint, that I could look at while developing.</li> 
    </ol> 
  <br> 
  <li> Adobe Illustrator </li> 
    <ol> 
      <li>Tried to stay away from using online stock images as I feel that this does not show that I am a good developer. Hence why not take this good opportunity to come up with something that nobody has come up with before. </li> 
    </ol> 
</ul>
